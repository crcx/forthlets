Forthlets - A Collection of Small Programs written in Forth
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This is a collection of small programs I've written in Forth.

They are all open source, and are intended to be used with
Retro. They will likely not work without major hacking on any
other Forth dialect.

You will need an extended Retro image, including the full set
of standard words, and the canvas library. With recent source
snapshots of Retro:

  make vm
  cd bin/library
  extend --new
  extend --with os-specific/canvas.retro

Or, go to http://retroforth.org/binaries/Images and get the
latest image file from there.

You can then load these using:

  retro --with path/to/filename

For the canvas demos, you'll need to shrink and convert the
images to javascript format:

  retro10/tools/shrinkImage
  retro10/tools/image2any javascript >retroImage.js
