- Perl (to run the www-server)

Todo

Want to help? Here's some stuff that needs to be done:

- Better support for embedding stylesheets, scripts

- Optionally escape output automatically:

- Testing

Example
-------

::

   : /
    ( html
      ( head ( title ." Demo Page" ) )
      ( body
        ( h1 ." Welcome to Retro" )
        ( p ." This is a test of the WWW package." )
      )
    )
   ;


The syntax is lispy, and is derived from Stefan's old retroweb system.

Links

   attr: href='url' ( a .... )

Properties
